# DNA Sequence Analysis in Bioinformatics

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script designed for the analysis of DNA sequences, particularly useful for undergraduates studying biology and learning bioinformatics. The provided script performs three fundamental analyses on a DNA sequence:
1. Counting the number of each nucleotide (A, T, C, G).
2. Determining the reverse complement of the DNA sequence.
3. Calculating the GC content as a percentage of the DNA sequence.

Accompanying the script is a detailed explanation aimed at helping students understand each part of the code.

## Contents

- `dna_analysis.py`: The main Python script for DNA sequence analysis.
- `dna_analysis_explanation.md`: A comprehensive explanation of the Python script, detailing the functionality and methodology.

## Usage

To run the DNA sequence analysis, simply execute the `dna_analysis.py` script. This script includes example DNA sequence data and will output the results of the analysis directly to the console.

### Example Output

```
DNA Sequence: ATGCGATACGCTTGC
Nucleotide Counts: {'A': 3, 'T': 4, 'C': 4, 'G': 4}
Reverse Complement: GCAAGCGTATCGCAT
GC Content: 53.33%
```

## How to Contribute

Contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions for improvements or additional features, please fork the repository and create a pull request.
